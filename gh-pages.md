### Who, When, Where

* DHH (David Heinemeier Hansson)
* 2004
* 37 Signals, a design firm in Chicago

--

### Base Camp 2005

* PHP or Java?
* PHP: messy
* Java: cumbersome
* DHH writes Rails in Ruby and builds in testing

--

### Why Ruby?

* PHP: lack of abstraction, too much repetitive code, unstructured
* Java: too much ceremony, too much configuration
* Ruby: metaprogramming for a "domain specific language" (DSL)
* Ruby: elegant and pleasurable
* Ruby: "package libraries" (RubyGems)

--

### Ruby Drawbacks

* Slow
* Poor parallel processing

--

### Rails Virtues

* opinionated and omakase ("the chef chooses")
* convention over configuration
* DRY ("Don’t Repeat Yourself")

--

### Rails Drawbacks

* sometimes Rails has no opinion
* omakase but "substitutions are allowed"
* conventions = magic
* DRY = obscure

--

### What is Rails?

* a "software package library" (RubyGem) for Ruby
* an API ("application programming interface")
* an open source community
* an economic community (marketplace)
